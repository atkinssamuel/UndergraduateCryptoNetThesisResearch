- With l1_scaling, l2_scaling = 0.00000001, 0.00000001, a learning_rate of 0.0005, and layer_complexity_growth = 2.5, the model is training too slow. Will try a higher learning rate because the loss is monotonically decreasing.

- With l1_scaling, l2_scaling = 0.00000001, 0.00000001, a learning_rate of 0.001, and layer_complexity_growth = 2.5, the model is successfully training and has no instability
