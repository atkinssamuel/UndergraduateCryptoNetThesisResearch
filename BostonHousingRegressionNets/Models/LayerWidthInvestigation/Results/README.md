### Exploded Model Results
This model has a single layer. The effects of varying the width of this layer were examined. The initial loss and the mean of the initial output as a function of the layer width was captured for both the squared and sigmoid activation functions. This will provide insight into the nature of the squared activation function. The results are contained in the "MagVsLayerWidthSigmoid" and "MagVsLayerWidthSquared" subdirectories.
