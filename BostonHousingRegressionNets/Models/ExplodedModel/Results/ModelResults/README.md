### Exploded Model Results
This model illustrates the exploding gradient problem when working with the squared activation function. The output size and the size of the loss grows with the number of nodes in each layer that utilizes the squared activation function. The model used for testing has a single hidden layer. This layer utilizes the squared activation function. The Figure below illustrates the magnitudes of the first 5 outputs as a function of the number of nodes in the hidden layer:
