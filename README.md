# Undergraduate CryptoNet Thesis Research:

## Project Organization
This project contains several subdirectories. The "unencrypted_classifier" subdirectory contains an unencrypted classifier that uses both convolutional and dense models to predict on the dataset. The "base_classifier" subdirectory contains an exceptionally simply CryptoNet. This subdirectory serves as a stepping stone for more complication architectures. 

Each subdirectory listed above contains the following folders:

```
/UndergraduateCryptoNetThesisResearch/<classifier_directory>/project
/UndergraduateCryptoNetThesisResearch/<classifier_directory>/results
```

The /project folder contains the files neccessary to train and test on the dataset. The /results folder contains all of the generated plots, tables, and/or information associated with that model.
